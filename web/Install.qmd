## Installation
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/KenHino/PyVibLocalizer
```

- In WSL2 or Ubuntu,
```bash
$ sudo apt install blender
```
- In Mac, 
```bash
$ brew install --cask blender
```

or simply install from [homepage](https://www.blender.org/). 

- First, modify PATH related to blender in `CMakeLists.txt` in PyVibLocalizer directory. Below is an example of PATH in Mac OS. (In Ubuntu, this may be `/usr/bin/blender`)
```cmake
set(BPython "/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/Resources/3.5/python/bin/python3.10")
set(BPythonDir "/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/Resources/3.5/python/")
set(Blender "/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender")
```

- Next, move to `test` directory and make `build` directory. And execute `cmake`.
```bash
$ cd test
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../..
```

- At last, activate virtual environment and execute a some example file such as `work/ch2o.py`.
```bash
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ blender --python main.py
```

- And you can also use jupyter notebook in blender. 
```bash
$ jupyter-lab
```
In jupyter notebook, you can use `blender_kernel` to execute blender script.
